ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠImportant Update from Massa â€“ New Email Requirement, KYC, Wallet Tips, and More!

Massa community, we have some important updates to share! Our journey towards the mainnet launch is progressing smoothly, and we want to ensure everyone is on track to be part of this major milestone.

Here's what you need to know:

 KYC Updates:
â€¢  Database Resynchronization: We've recently resynchronized our database with our KYC provider, Synaps. If you've had any issues with your KYC status, now's the time to check again!
â€¢  Support for Rejected KYCs: If your KYC was rejected, don't worry! The dashboard now displays Synaps' support contact email and your unique session ID. Use these when seeking help to resolve any issues.

 Upcoming Tasks â€“ Stay Alert:
â€¢  Email Address Requirement: Attention: we need you to provide an email address in the dashboard to be eligible for possible upcoming happy surprises. Whether you've participated in a quest campaign, are an ambassador, a node runner, or have interacted with our dashboard in any way, it's time to update your profile. Visit https://dashboard.massa.foundation/, navigate to your profile section, and enter your email in the provided field.
â€¢  Pre-filled email fields: Ambassadors and KYC-approved participants, we tried to pre-fill with the email you used during the KYC process. Feel free to check and update it if needed.

 Calling All Node Runners:
â€¢  Account fusion updates: we have found a bug in account fusion that prevents some of you from claiming points form other accounts. We are still investigating the issue and expect to deliver a fix this week. Note that the fix might require those who have used the buggy account fusion feature to re-do their fusion claims. More on that soon.
â€¢  Bonus Eligibility: Testnet node runners who accumulated a minimum of 200 points by the end of testnet 24 and scored 300 points in the last four testnets have a choice to make in the dashboard about their bonus 10 rolls. Would you prefer to receive the bonus as initial rolls or as tokens? Remember, initial rolls can yield higher staking returns, but this requires your nodes to be operational right at the mainnet launch.
â€¢  Pre-Launch Coordination: Opting to be an initial node runner? We'll sync with you just before launch to ensure you're ready to be a part of Massa's initial network infrastructure.

 Extended Deadline:
More Time for You: We understand the importance of these steps, so we're extending the deadline to December 13th. This gives everyone a chance to complete their tasks and join us for the exciting journey ahead.

We're thrilled to have you with us. Stay connected, stay updated, and let's make Massa's launch a resounding success! ![Screenshot_5](https://github.com/fatalbar/Testnet-validator/assets/81378817/1a014f99-a006-4cb1-a160-02c4e1ae8821)
