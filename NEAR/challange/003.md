## Stake Wars: Episode III. Challenge 003
* Published on: 2022-07-13
* Updated on: 2022-07-15
* Submitted by: Open Shards Alliance
* Rewards: 10 Unlocked NEAR Points (UNP)
* Deploy a new staking pool for your validator. Do operations on your staking pool to delegate and stake NEAR.


## Mounting a staking pool
NEAR uses a staking pool factory with a whitelisted staking contract to ensure delegators’ funds are safe. In order to run a validator on NEAR, a staking pool must be deployed to a NEAR account and integrated into a NEAR validator node. Delegators must use a UI or the command line to stake to the pool. A staking pool is a smart contract that is deployed to a NEAR account.

Deploy a Staking Pool Contract
Deploy a Staking Pool
Calls the staking pool factory, creates a new staking pool with the specified name, and deploys it to the indicated accountId.
```bash
near call factory.shardnet.near create_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_id": "your_wallet", "owner_id": "xx.shardnet.near", "stake_public_key": "your_public_key", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 5, "denominator": 100}, "code_hash":"DD428g9eqLL8fWUxv8QSpVFzyHi1Qd16P8ephYCTmMSZ"}' --accountId="xx.shardnet.near" --amount=30 --gas=30000000000000
```
From the example above, you need to replace:

* `your_wallet` change with your wallet name (example:`fatalbar`).

* `xx.shardnet.near` change xx with your accountid

* `your_public_key` change with your public_key wallet, you can using command
* `--amount=30` you can replace `30` with amount want to stake on validator,in my last task im staking with `400`NEAR
```bash
cat ~/.near/validator_key.json | jq .public_key
```

To change the pool parameters, such as changing the amount of commission charged to 1% in the example below, use this command:
```bash
near call <pool_name> update_reward_fee_fraction '{"reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 1, "denominator": 100}}' --accountId <account_id> --gas=30000000000000
```
You will see something like this:
![180383828-272a660e-0a1a-4252-a5f4-880e3961e49f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81378817/181397133-f75865c2-d15c-4c11-beed-4c648b23939f.png)

If there is a “True” at the End. Your pool is created.

You have now configure your Staking pool.

Check your pool is now visible on https://explorer.shardnet.near.org/nodes/validators

## Transactions Guide
Deposit and Stake NEAR
Command:
```bash
near call <staking_pool_id> deposit_and_stake --amount <amount> --accountId <accountId> --gas=30000000000000
```
Unstake NEAR
Amount in yoctoNEAR.

Run the following command to unstake:
```bash
near call <staking_pool_id> unstake '{"amount": "<amount yoctoNEAR>"}' --accountId <accountId> --gas=30000000000000
```
To unstake all you can run this one:
```bash
near call <staking_pool_id> unstake_all --accountId <accountId> --gas=30000000000000
```
Withdraw
Unstaking takes 2-3 epochs to complete, after that period you can withdraw in YoctoNEAR from pool.

Command:
```bash
near call <staking_pool_id> withdraw '{"amount": "<amount yoctoNEAR>"}' --accountId <accountId> --gas=30000000000000
```
Command to withdraw all:
```bash
near call <staking_pool_id> withdraw_all --accountId <accountId> --gas=30000000000000
```
Ping
A ping issues a new proposal and updates the staking balances for your delegators. A ping should be issued each epoch to keep reported rewards current.

Command:
```bash
near call <staking_pool_id> ping '{}' --accountId <accountId> --gas=30000000000000
```
Balances Total Balance Command:
```bash
near view <staking_pool_id> get_account_total_balance '{"account_id": "<accountId>"}'
```
Staked Balance
Command:
```bash
near view <staking_pool_id> get_account_staked_balance '{"account_id": "<accountId>"}'
```
Unstaked Balance
Command:
```bash
near view <staking_pool_id> get_account_unstaked_balance '{"account_id": "<accountId>"}'
```
Available for Withdrawal
You can only withdraw funds from a contract if they are unlocked.

Command:
```bash
near view <staking_pool_id> is_account_unstaked_balance_available '{"account_id": "<accountId>"}'
```
Pause / Resume Staking
Pause
Command:
```bash
near call <staking_pool_id> pause_staking '{}' --accountId <accountId>
```
Resume
Command:
```bash
near call <staking_pool_id> resume_staking '{}' --accountId <accountId>
```
